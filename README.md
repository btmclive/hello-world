My name is Edward. I'm a 24 year old Chinese-American dude who likes video games (crazy). After graduating from High School, I took a gap year to take live-streaming seriously and as of March 9th, 2018 I am now Full-Time.

I primarily stream [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home), a free to play/free to win rhythm game but will also occasionally stream other games from time to time.
